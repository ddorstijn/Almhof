Pension Almhof is centrally located on a quiet, sunny spot with a panoramic view. It is surrounded by several (swimming) lakes and winter sports areas. The beautiful Afritzersee is only a 5 minutes drive away and the skiing area of the Gerlitzen Alpe is at +/- 12 minutes. Because the pension is situated at (only) 100 meters above the village of Afritz, accessibility is very good and peace is guaranteed. A top location for you!
